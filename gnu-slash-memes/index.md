an index of memes, memeables, and pop culture items, under public licenses such as [creative commons](https://creativecommons.org/) or in the [public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain)

most of the time this doesn't matter because youtube has contracts for most of the world's music and all the other companies know better than to sue random memesters for giving them free marketing
but if you're publishing something commercially (or if your teacher insists on properly licensed material for your slideshow) and you wanna put a haha funny in it then this might be helpful

a quick rundown:
- [`pd`](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/) (public domain) means it's too old for copyright so do Literally Whatever; this may vary depending on your country
- [`0`](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) means much the same but applied intentionally, so the work is probably more modern
- [`by`](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) means credit (e.g. link in the description, maybe a sneaky watermark if in an image); however it *also* usually means no drm which might be an issue if you're developing for ios
- [`sa`](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) means if you publish edits of it (or things synced to it if music) you have to release them under the same license
- [`nd`](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/) means don't you dare publish edits of it
- [`nc`](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) means non-commercial
- `*` means there's a catch because copyright is often not as shrimple as that

very incomplete as of current; if you have any suggestions then contact is appreciated
