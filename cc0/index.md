this website, and much of the stuff i make in general, is licensed under [cc0 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
which is less a license and more a [public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) dedication with a fallback where that's not possible (because lawmakers didn't predict this level of ~~masochism~~ altruism)
so here's info on that (or you can read [the official faq](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0_FAQ))

# what can i do
tl;dr: pretty much anything

| can i... | answer |
| :- | :- |
| use your things? | **yes** |
| commercially? | **yes** |
| edit them? | **yes** |
| without credit? | **yes** (but i do appreciate credit) |
| for nazi things? | **yes** (but fuck you) |
| with *me* credited? | uhhhh **not sure** honestly |
| post them to spotify/etc? | **no** (but it's because [they want you to own it](https://freepd.com/#:~:text=Can%20I%20put,local%20copyright%20attorney.)) |

# however

this website sometimes contains things that can't be cc0'd, e.g. translations of other people's works or fan-art
it should be clear from context when that's the case, or if you're a context-incapable scraper you can look for the `copyrighted` html class

# why so permissive

## i don't feel like i ever put effort into anything
if i ever do then i might use some sort of copyleft or even [copyfarleft](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Copyfarleft) license
but for now i'm not worried about my things being abused commercially or for nazi purposes because there's not much there *to* abuse

## it's not like i'm gonna sue anyone anyway
individual bad actors don't usually care about copyright anyway (and especially not about the author's wishes)
and companies (assuming they wanna steal my garbage in the first place) have lawyers and i don't
youtube copyright claims are a thing i guess but i'd have to dox myself and all and beh

## i think most people who would credit with cc-by would credit with cc0 too when practical
see: [minecraft sound attributions](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/attribution/sound
and i'd rather not force myself on them, e.g. if someone were to make a song that's a mishmash of samples (a la [marble soda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAeybdD5UoQ)) it would be impractical to credit a hundred separate artists wherever the song's used
[here's](https://dancohen.org/2013/11/26/cc0-by/) a similar idea in the context of datasets

## did you know [cc-by has an anti-drm clause](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/175/can-i-redistribute-cc-by-works-in-drm-protected-app-stores)
which yeah that's based but it's a real problem for ios developers (at least real enough that [oga-by](https://opengameart.org/content/oga-by-30-faq) exists)
in a similar vein cc0 is actually unsuitable for code because [it doesn't give patent rights](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/133/how-could-using-code-released-under-cc0-infringe-on-the-authors-patents)
there's a fork called [cc_-1](https://carado.moe/cc_-1.html) (which is a bit weird in its phrasing) but i often just quadruple-license under cc0/[unlicense](https://unlicense.org/)/[0bsd](https://opensource.org/license/0bsd/)/[wtfpl](http://www.wtfpl.net/) because it's funny

## is anything bad even gonna happen
[nicky case](https://ncase.me/) is way more popular than me and cc0's all her stuff and i don't think there's any notable misuse of it
also this sounds iffy but perhaps: if others sell my stuff then that just tells me there's a market for me to do it *and* i can perhaps get some publicity from calling them out (not like "hey they stole my stuff" just "hey this stuff is free elsewhere")
