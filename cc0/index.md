excerpt: "why i license things the way i do"

this website, and much of the stuff i make in general, is licensed under [cc0 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
which is less a license and more a [public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) dedication with a fallback where that's not possible (because lawmakers didn't predict this level of ~~masochism~~ altruism)
so here's info on that (or you can read [the official faq](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0_FAQ))

# what can i do
tl;dr: pretty much anything

| can i... | answer |
| :- | :- |
| use your things? | **yes** |
| commercially? | **yes** |
| edit them? | **yes** |
| for nazi things? | **yes** (but fuck you) |
| without credit? | **yes** (but i do appreciate credit) |
| train a neural network on them? | **yes** (and please tell me about it) |
| with *false* credit? | uhhhh **not sure** honestly |
| post them to spotify/etc? | **no** (but it's because [they want you to be the owner](https://freepd.com/#:~:text=Can%20I%20put,local%20copyright%20attorney.)) |

# however

this website sometimes contains things that can't be cc0'd, e.g. translations of other people's works or fan-art
it should be clear from context when that's the case, or if you're a context-incapable scraper you can look for the `.copyrighted` html class

# why so permissive

## i don't feel like i ever put effort into anything
if i ever do then i might use some sort of copyleft or even [copyfarleft](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Copyfarleft) license
but for now i'm not worried about my things being abused commercially or for nazi purposes because there's not much there *to* abuse

## it's not like i'm gonna sue anyone anyway
individual bad actors don't usually care about copyright anyway (and especially not about the author's wishes)
and companies (assuming they wanna steal my garbage in the first place) have lawyers and i don't
youtube copyright claims are a thing i guess but i'd have to dox myself and all and beh

## i think most people who would credit with cc-by would credit with cc0 too when practical
see: [minecraft sound attributions](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/attribution/sound
and i'd rather not force myself on them, e.g. if someone were to make a song that's a mishmash of samples (a la [marble soda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAeybdD5UoQ)) it would be impractical to credit a hundred separate artists wherever the song's used
[here's](https://dancohen.org/2013/11/26/cc0-by/) a similar idea in the context of datasets

## did you know [cc-by has an anti-drm clause](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/175/can-i-redistribute-cc-by-works-in-drm-protected-app-stores)
which yeah that's based but it's a real problem for ios developers (at least real enough that [oga-by](https://opengameart.org/content/oga-by-30-faq) exists)
,,though in a similar vein cc0 is unsuitable for code because [it doesn't give patent rights](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/133/how-could-using-code-released-under-cc0-infringe-on-the-authors-patents)
there's a fork called [cc_-1](https://carado.moe/cc_-1.html) (which is a bit weird in its phrasing), while every so often i quadruple-license under cc0/[unlicense](https://unlicense.org/)/[0bsd](https://opensource.org/license/0bsd/)/[wtfpl](http://www.wtfpl.net/) because it's funny
<small>it might also be the case that [copyright law makes it impossible for any license at all to be irrevocable](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Shrinking_the_Commons:_Termination_of_Copyright_Licenses_and_Transfers_for_the_Benefit_of_the_Public) but shhh</small>

## is anything bad even gonna happen
[nicky case](https://ncase.me/) is way more popular than me and cc0Â·s all her stuff and i don't think there's any notable misuse of it
also this sounds iffy but perhaps: if others sell my stuff then that just tells me there's a market for me to do it *and* i can perhaps get some publicity from calling them out (not like "hey they stole my stuff" just "hey this stuff is free elsewhere")

## wait aren't i [afraid of ai](/on-ai-art/)
i wrote the "train a neural network" part before the realization hit me, now i'm honestly not sure
currently tentatively keeping it because if someone bothers to ask me they're probably training a non-threateningly small network with sub-human capabilities, whereas the networks i'm worried about are generally trained without consent
but that might change soon, and while i don't have many works to speak of uhh something something principle of the thing idk
(also the organization that published the license [holds](https://creativecommons.org/2023/02/17/fair-use-training-generative-ai/) that training models constitutes fair use, that's not very relevant but i wanted to put it here)
