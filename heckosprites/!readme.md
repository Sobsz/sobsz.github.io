(if you wanna see the code click [here](https://github.com/Sobsz/sobsz.github.io/tree/master/heckosprites/make), you can't see it normally because of the file limit but it's there i swear)

# HOW TO USE
1. type https://sobsz.github.io/heckosprites/
2. add the character corresponding to your desired eyes
3. do the same but with the mouth
4. put b, s, and/or x at the end for blush, sweat, and sans eye respectively
5. add png if you want, it's not necessary but you can do it

for example, https://sobsz.github.io/heckosprites/4csx.png results in an "oh snap i forgot something brb guys" type of look with sweat and a sans eye

# SHORTCUTS

(use these instead of the letters, you can still add the sans eye if you want but not b or s because they're already included)
