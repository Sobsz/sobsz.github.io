# general

<details>
<summary markdown="span">name: **hecko**</summary>
if that's not available then **hecko_yes** or similar

used to be **Sobsz**, and it's still the username for some of my accounts, but i'm changing it wherever possible because:
- it's a pain to pronounce even for my fellow poles
- lowercase good
- <small>it mayormaynot be derived from my legal name</small>
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">pronouns: **he/they**/it/neoprns</summary>
i mostly don't care *but* i know she/her feels wrong
and i like messing with language, hence neopronouns (though fae/faer feels a bit like she/her and either way a bit too mystical for me)
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">gender: **male?**</summary>
definitely not female, but other than that i'm not sure how much i care about my maleness<br>
i like calling myself "boy" sometimes, e.g. "guess i'm your delivery boy"<br>
i sometimes say "male/none, whichever you think is less unusual", based on an unfounded theory of mine that: many people who call themselves cis (including me) actually don't have much of a gender (or don't care much about it), so while just calling myself "genderless" would be more accurate it'd also cause me to be perceived by many as more unusual than i really am

<details>
<summary markdown="span">age: **{{ "now" | date: "%s" | minus: 1049493600 | date: "%Y" | minus: 1970 }}**</summary>
born april 5, 2003
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">sexuality: **ace**-ish</summary>
more specifically [aegosexual](https://www.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Aegosexual), meaning i enjoy the idea of sexytimes but actually *doing* it is a no thanks

romanticity-wise i'm not sure but am taken (brionna ðŸ’œ)
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">autism: **yes**</summary>
technically diagnosed as asperger's but	[yikes](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-truth-about-hans-aspergers-nazi-collusion/)

see the [mental quirks](#mental-quirks) section
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">location: **poland**</summary>
and yet i managed to end up worse at polish than at english :)
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">languages: **english, polish, toki pona**</summary>
i call myself 2.5-lingual because [toki pona is a game a little above pig latin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zCbq2sFCgY&t=131s)

vaguely tried learning german, russian, esperanto, and spanish; gave up each time, guess my brain doesn't like language learning

# mental quirks

## mindblock

sometimes my brain decides it Can't do something and refuses to try, even when there are consequences to not doing it
extremely specific step-by-step instructions might help with that (especially with explanations as to why they are what they are), but people tend to be unwilling to provide such
though even then i'll probably think i'm doing it wrong oops

things i want to get into but haven't because of (at least) the above:
- social deduction games
- writing
- tabletop rpgÂ·s
- [creaturing](https://cohost.org/hecko/post/2089141-notes-on-quest-for)

## self-strictness

i sometimes give myself standards that i don't expect anyone else to follow (vaguely like [postel's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle))
or is it just that i'm a pushover

## emotion issues

i don't think i feel much? at the very least i know i can feel:
- fear/stress
- arousal
- maybe frustration?
and the vast majority of the time i feel neutral
it might be that the emotions still exist and i still act on them subconsciously, just don't directly feel them
it's probably depression, or perhaps dissociation

## [arithmomania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmomania)

or well not really *mania*, though it does happen often
counting the lines in a long post for example, scrolling by eights or tens
if i see something that has numbers i'll often add up the digits
when i do something directional (e.g. blink with my left eye) i might feel the need to balance it out using the [thue-morse sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thue%E2%80%93Morse_sequence) (lrrl rllr rllr lrrl, repeat fractally)

for lines or short phrases i might try to fit them into a grid and take note of the non-space characters, e.g.:
1.	"this is odd" splits into `this|.is.|odd.` which has uneven space distribution so it's displeasing
2.	thus i'll add a space in front and get `.thi|s.is|.odd`, which is better but has spaces at the start and repeats the blank-char-char-char arrangement twice
3.	after some shuffling i might end up with "is this odd" which splits into `is.t|his.|odd.`, that still has a repeat arrangement though so i'd prefer something like `i.am|.mon|key.` or `a.co|ol.b|ird.`

## mimicry

i can and will quote memes verbatim, whether textually or verbally
and get mildly annoyed when someone else subtly misquotes them (don't worry y'all it's not actually wrong i'm just picky)
less verbatimÂ·ly i sometimes say things not because i mean them but because they sound right ([gpt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer) moment)

## grinding

for some reason i just like doing repetitive things with incremental progress, or at least the idea thereof!
examples include: [distributed proofreading](https://www.pgdp.net/), [mozilla common voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/), digging out a chunk in minecraft
heck i'm the type of person to play [nationstates](https://www.nationstates.net/) purely for the training cards

# interests

## programming

not surprising given my autism
mostly small bespoke python scripts (i really like [list comprehensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension))

## sentence mixing

a common part of [youtube poops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_poop), and my personal favorite
iunno i just like the texture of chopped-up audio, and while ai voice cloning is cool (and i have done it) it just hits differently
even better when it's autotuned into a ytpmv

## language restrictions

[avoiding the letter `e`](https://reddit.com/r/AVoid5), [speaking using only a hundred-something words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona), 

## drawing?

i don't think of myself as a creative type but my brain pushed me to learn to draw, or at least try to
as of writing the "learning" is just 30 minutes daily of the drawing game [interference](https://www.playinterference.com/)
outside of that i mostly like non-antialiased brushes because they're easy to erase cleanly (and vector art because that's infinite fiddleability)

# sensory cravings

what my touch-starved ass thinks would bring it comfort

## pressure

squeeze me, lay on me, bring some friends over, [compress me into a zip file](https://twitter.com/mgracereyn/status/1506816355416227842)
mostly just lay on me though, especially if you're a large quadruped

apparently this is an autism thing, so much so they [invented an autist squisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hug_machine)
though also when i was like 10 my family had a thing where we'd lay on each other and call it a sandwich, maybe that's what made me like it?

in imaginary scenarios it can and will get more extreme
an oddly persistent and specific fantasy is to be squeezed between a pair of buff 8-foot-tall werewolves (platonically), hugging each other super tightly
another is being physics-disregardingly compressed into tiny sizes, which uhhh:

<summary markdown="span">links to image examples **[weird and maybe nsfw, viewer beware]**</summary>
- [cube](https://www.furaffinity.net/view/50770781/)
- [house](https://www.furaffinity.net/view/47408337/)
- [plush suit](https://www.furaffinity.net/view/52096734/)

</details>

## squishiness

in contrast to fluffiness, which i do enjoy but am very picky about (plus i just tend to prefer this)
i just wanna smother my face in a big marshmallowy dragon belly (or huge squishy tail) is that weird (yes)
that or fidget with a toony anthro's pawpads or a pony's hoof

you'll notice most of my [fursonÃ¦](/fursonae/) have no hard bits anywhere (sometimes not even bones), this is why
i also tend to assume all drawn creatures are squishy unless there's evidence otherwise (and sometimes [in spite of](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/122744/do-my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-ponies-have-coats))

## cold water

or just cold, or maybe just water
i wanna hug a [vaporeon](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Vaporeon) (and it better not have scales)

## thigh-highs

never wore 'em, i just think they'd be comfy
