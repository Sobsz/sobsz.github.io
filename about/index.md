# general

<details>
<summary markdown="span">name: **hecko**</summary>
if that's not available then **hecko_yes** or similar

used to be **Sobsz**, and it's still the username for some of my accounts, but i'm changing it wherever possible because:
- it's a pain to pronounce even for my fellow poles
- lowercase good
- <small>it mayormaynot be derived from my legal name</small>
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">pronouns: **he/they**/it/neoprns</summary>
i mostly don't care *but* i know she/her feels wrong
and i like messing with language, hence neopronouns (though fae/faer feels a bit like she/her and either way a bit too mystical for me)
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">gender: **male?**</summary>
definitely not female, but other than that i'm not sure how much i care about my maleness
i like calling myself "boy" sometimes, e.g. "guess i'm your delivery boy"
i sometimes say "male/none, whichever you think is less unusual", based on an unfounded theory of mine that: many people who call themselves cis (including me) actually don't have much of a gender (or don't care much about it), so while just calling myself "genderless" would be more accurate it'd also cause me to be perceived by many as more unusual than i really am
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">age: **{{ "now" | date: "%s" | minus: 1049493600 | date: "%Y" | minus: 1970 }}**</summary>
born april 5, 2003
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">sexuality: **ace**-ish</summary>
more specifically [aegosexual](https://www.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Aegosexual), meaning i enjoy the idea of sexytimes but actually *doing* it is a no thanks

romanticity-wise i'm not sure but am taken
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">autism: **yes**</summary>
technically diagnosed as asperger's but	[yikes](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-truth-about-hans-aspergers-nazi-collusion/)

see the [mental quirks](#mental-quirks) section
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">location: **poland**</summary>
and yet i managed to end up worse at polish than at english :)
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">languages: **english, polish, toki pona**</summary>
i call myself 2.5-lingual because [toki pona is a game a little above pig latin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zCbq2sFCgY&t=131s)

vaguely tried learning german, russian, esperanto, and spanish; gave up each time, guess my brain doesn't like language learning

# mental quirks

## mindblock

sometimes my brain decides it Can't do something and refuses to try, even when there are consequences
extremely specific instructions help i think, but people tend to be unwilling to provide such

## emotion issues

i don't think i feel much? at the very least i know i can feel:
- fear/stress
- arousal
- maybe frustration?
and the vast majority of the time i feel neutral
it might be that the emotions still exist and i still act on them subconsciously, just don't directly feel them
it's probably depression, or perhaps dissociation

## [arithmomania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmomania)

i wouldn't call it a *mania*, more of a habit than anything
counting the lines in a long post for example, scrolling by eights or tens
if i see something that has numbers i'll often add up the digits
when i do something directional (e.g. blink with my left eye) i might feel the need to balance it out using the [thue-morse sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thue%E2%80%93Morse_sequence) (lrrl rllr rllr lrrl, repeat fractally)
for lines or short phrases i might try to fit them into a grid and take note of the non-space characters, e.g.: 
1.	`this is odd` splits into `this| is |odd ` which has uneven space distribution so it's displeasing
2.	thus i'll add a space in front and get ` thi|s is| odd`, which is better but has spaces at the start and repeats the blank-char-char-char arrangement twice
3.	after some shuffling i might end up with `is this odd` which splits into `is t|his |odd `, still repeats so i'd prefer something like `i am| mon|key ` or `a co|ol b|ird `

## mimicry

i can and will quote memes verbatim, whether textually or verbally
and get mildly annoyed when someone else subtly misquotes them (don't worry y'all it's not actually wrong i'm just picky)

# interests

## programming

not surprising given my autism
mostly small bespoke python scripts (i really like [list comprehensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension))

## sentence mixing

a common part of [youtube poops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_poop), and my personal favorite
iunno i just like the texture of chopped-up audio, and while ai voice cloning is cool (and i have done it) it just hits differently
even better when it's autotuned into a ytpmv

## drawing?

i don't think of myself as a creative type but my brain pushed me to learn to draw, or at least try to
as of writing the "learning" is just 30 minutes daily of the drawing game [interference](https://www.playinterference.com/)
outside of that i mostly like non-antialiased brushes because they're easy to erase cleanly (and vector art because that's infinite fiddleability)

# sensory cravings

what my touch-starved ass thinks would bring it comfort

## pressure

squeeze me, lay on me, bring some friends over, [compress me into a zip file](https://twitter.com/mgracereyn/status/1506816355416227842)
mostly just lay on me though, especially if you're a large quadruped
apparently this is an autism thing, so much so they [invented an autist squisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hug_machine)
in fantasy scenarios it can and will get more extreme, [here's a bit of a weird example](https://www.furaffinity.net/view/47408337/) **(note that the artist's other images are weirder)**

## squishiness

in contrast to fluffiness, which i do enjoy but am very picky about (plus i just tend to prefer this)
i just wanna smother my face in a big marshmallowy dragon belly (or huge squishy tail) is that weird (yes)
that or push down on a furry's pawpads or a pony's hoof
you'll notice most of my [furson√¶](/fursonae/) have no hard bits anywhere (sometimes not even bones), this is why

## cold water

or just cold, or maybe just water
i wanna hug a [vaporeon](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Vaporeon) (and it better not have scales)

## thigh-highs

never wore 'em, i just think they'd be comfy
