<p style="text-align: center"><strong>[self-deprecation·y moods abound; also i think i subconsciously refuse help on this topic but you're welcome to try dm·ing me anyway i guess]</strong></p>

i want to have the ability to do half-decent art (or even quarter-decent art)
i am not putting examples of my current art here because a) it doesn't exist and b) people are just gonna say it's "good" when it's not (to me)
nothing realistic or impressive, just stuff like [aimkid](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAPwJEqyypq9q895BD6DsqQ) (sans animation) or [yorushika](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6S2s7fteUaAgKw4E_h1SqQ) or [morxvx](https://twitter.com/morxwx/) or [cwitchy](https://www.youtube.com/c/Cwitchy) or honestly even the [cdi cutscenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfWGYW4uZVg) yes i'm that desperate
obstacles to that:
1. my tear ducts activate whenever i think about drawing 
2. see rest of page

# what do

there's much information online but it all disagrees with each other

i saw a video (that i can't find now) with someone saying he spent years learning photorealistic art to build up a solid base before daring to do cartoons ("you must know the rules to break them") and that others should do the same
that's demotivating for one but also my main artist friend (electriclizardfren) did none of that! and his art is very good!
he says that he has no idea how he learned and that he just draws and magically becomes good at it over time, which a) sounds like how i do programming (which is talent in my case, which is bad news due to my lack of artistic talent) and b) i can't do that because i can't have fun drawing because i suck at it and can't just ignore that
,,maybe that's the main problem actually, not wanting to do art because i suck at it
in which case How do i Fix that Please Tell Me (but with specific actionable instructions instead of "simply Don't Be Like That™" because that doesn't help or "it's okay to suck at first" because i already know that intellectually but my brain refuses to accept it)

and then there's ethan becker whom i was *explicitly recommended by a good artist* ([nickeman132](https://twitter.com/nickeman132)) with such takes as:
- ["never leave your comfort zone"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqZhb5hRs5g)
- ["drawing more will never ever make you better"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxoTwEdbbgQ_)
- ["never draw from imagination"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEvMHRgPdyk) but also ["never draw from photo reference"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxcIXNrzu4s)

<small>i know they're probably more nuanced than that and/or clickbait i'm just mad</small>

[this one](https://drawabox.com/) says i should do boxes first, [this one](https://line-of-action.com/index.php) gesture drawing; during april 2022 (my month of [drawing/suffering]) i didn't know which to pick and tried both and didn't progress much in either (and also ended up giving up early)
probably a mixture of being unfocused and doing the same easy thing over and over again instead of actually advancing (the gesture drawing site doesn't seem to have any progression curve? at all?)

also: How Do I [Deliberate Practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)#Deliberate_practice)
"just do it" *How*
have i ever done anything deliberately in my life even

# how motivation

i can't even motivate myself to watch a youtube video without getting distracted every minute
and even when i do it's hard to keep it up, i can't even keep up a duolingo streak for more than a couple months
<small>i think my longest ever streak was when i was like 13 and decided to do A Workout (from [skimble workout trainer](https://www.skimble.com/)) every day and i mean i *technically* did but a good chunk of them were in bed at 10pm because i forgot to do them all day</small>

and it's not like i don't have time, i just keep wasting it on mindlessly meandering through the web
but with university coming up (and then work) i'll probably *actually* not have time and then i'm double screwed

doesn't help that i can't place my drawing tablet anywhere comfortably (even on a table with a ton of space because my laptop has to be further away which throws me off)
drawing on paper is an option but it's more conspicuous (mom found my april stash and started commenting on it and i hated it)

i've once been suggested to get an art tutor but that's a lotta money for something i probably wouldn't end up learning from anyway
and if somehow free tutors exist that's even worse since they don't even get the satisfaction of having taught someone because see above

# why bother

as of 2022-09-31 ai art is Here and it's probably only ever gonna get more here
sure the stock stable diffusion model sucks at furries but i've *seen* what a finetuned model can do and it's *glorious*
and even if it turns out that this iteration just Cannot Do Cartoon Style Ever there's gonna be another one that can in a couple years (definitely sooner than i'll be able to at this rate)
and once it's there it's gonna be even harder to motivate myself to learn, since what's the point of tearing up

there's also the possibility of commissions but that causes the conflict of "i should pay this artist enough money to make up for bothering them" vs "is a single drawing of my honse *really* worth that much money"

additionally [oh look here's a study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797614535810) and it says that practice only affects up to a quarter of one's skill so even if i had magically gotten myself to practice an hour every day for years i could still have ended up worse than a teenager who just Happens To Have Talent (such as aforementioned artist friend)
i've seen art progression charts that go from "godly" to "ungodly" in a few months, and i've seen ones that go from "bleh" to "still bleh" in a few years, and honestly what's the likelihood that my uncreative autistic ass ends up in the first category

and honestly i'm not sure if i even actually *want* to art
surely if i did want to i would've tried harder
maybe i just wanna be mad

# in conclusion

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
