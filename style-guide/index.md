how 2 write like me (work in progress)
thought up independently of but encouraged by the existence of [marijn van hoorn's style guide](https://satyrs.eu/styleguide/)

# markup

## case

i write in all lowercase by default, not making exceptions for the pronoun `i` nor proper names (except toki pona ones)
when capitalization does occur it's usually used for emphasis (e.g. `it just Doesn't Work Like That`)

## numbers

i almost always write numbers as digits, except in compounds like `twofold` and such

## punctuation

general rule: punctuation represents not only grammar things but also how the text would be intonated if it were spoken

no period at the end of the sentence other than to clarify intonation (e.g. `huh.` as opposed to `huh` which feels like a question)
non-question non-exclamation sentences are instead most commonly separated with line breaks, sometimes with [commas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_splice), rarely with semicolons
this can cause ambiguity when the end of one sentence ends up on the right side of the screen, making it look like it continues into the next line (this website avoids it by making each sentence a "paragraph" with minimal padding and making actual paragraphs be `<div>`s)
commas and question marks are also often omitted except where that would cause ambiguity
multiple commas (2 by default, can even be 1 sometimes) are used as [ellipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis), which is [quite popular among youngins it seems](https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/comma-ellipses)
[oxford comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma) is yes

## quotation marks

my brain likes to interpret quotation marks as [scare quotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scare_quotes) even when they're not, so instead i tend to use backticks (`` ` ``), which due to [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) makes the text look like code in places like reddit and discord and this website
(when i *do* intend to do scare quotes i often multiply them a bunch, e.g. `"""""dubious"""""`)
when discussing other languages (e.g. toki pona), i use backticks to quote that language and fall back to quotation marks for english, with angle quotes (`«»`) used for yet other languages
when writing formally (which is rare) i put the ending punctuation of a quoted sentence inside the quotation marks and the ending punctuation of the outer sentence outside the quotation marks; should be common sense but [apparently it isn't](https://writeshop.com/how-to-use-quotation-marks/) (though i do admit doubled punctuation can look kinda ugly, e.g. `They said "Let's go.".`)

## slashes

regular usage: `i want a cat/dog/whatever`
square brackets when part of word: `i want a [boy/girl/enby]friend` (sometimes )
spaces around slashes when more than one word: `i want sugar / spice / everything nice`
(alternatively: `i want sugar/spice/everything·nice`)

## strikethrough

strikethrough marks sentences that i'd mumble under my breath in speech, sorta like [`/j`](https://tonetags.carrd.co/)

## trademark sign

a trademark sign can mark that a given word/phrase has a,, special meaning i guess? kinda like the `Soon™` meme but with a broader fuzzier harder to define meaning (maybe it's just emphasis or random spice who knows)

## interpunct

the interpunct (`·`) is so cool that it gets a special shortcut on my keyboard, [altgr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltGr) + `.` (and you can do it too with [autohotkey™](https://autohotkey.com/))
i use it to mark suffixes after single letters or acronyms (`nft·s`, `ssh·ing`, but `ddos'd`), as well as "clarify" hyphen nesting order

# grammar

## rule of funny

verb all the nouns, mispluralize all the wordi, *doubly* pluralize all the pluralses, if it looks funny then do it

## casualness

technically unnecessary filler, so like y'know the uh,, yeah
every so often i wanna stop using it but then i don't

## uncasualness

i sometimes go sesquipedalian, either for comedic effect or because i genuinely don't know the simple word for the given thing
i also use `one` instead of generic `you` because it just makes more sense to me (heck that should be a category of its own)

## extrapolation

if `don't` can be a thing then why not `y'all'dn't've` (= `you all would not have`)
if the plural of `octopus` is `octopi` then for `corpus` i'll do `corpi` and you can't stop me (not in serious writing though)

## regionality

generally american english but i feel like e.g. `labelled` looks better than `labeled`
usually [24-hour time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock) except when it feels wrong or ambiguous, in which case 12-hour time without a space before the period name (e.g. `4:20am`)

## no standard shortenings

except those specified in [word replacements](#word-replacements)

# neologisms

- **khhh** - like `pfff` but velar (in the back of the mouth) instead of labial (in the lips)

# appendix: toki pona

sentences on the same line are split with an interpunct with spaces on either side
in semi-formal writing, interpuncts are also added at the *start and end* of the line, vaguely resembling an indent and also because symmetry is nice
commas around `la` and after `taso` are not used, but the function of a semicolon after `ni` is fulfilled by an arrow pointing right; arrows can also point left to function as a backwards semicolon of sorts
example:

> · open pi tenpo suno ni la mi kama lukin e ni → soweli li moku e kasi ale mi ← ni li ike tawa mi · taso mi ken ala ike tawa soweli tan suwi ona ·
